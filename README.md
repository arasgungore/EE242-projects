# ee242-projects

Three C++ projects assigned for the Numerical Methods for Electrical Engineering (EE 242) course on Spring 2021 semester. These projects apply algorithms such as
Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting (GEPP), normalized power iteration, inverse iteration, secant and bisection methods to solve matrix and polynomial equations.



## Projects

[Project 1: Gaussian Elimination with Partial Pivoting](GaussianEliminationWithPartialPivoting)

[Project 2: Computing Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors using Normalized Power Iteration Algorithm and Inverse Iteration Algorithm](ComputingEigenvaluesAndEigenvectors)

[Project 3: Secant and Bisection Methods](SecantAndBisectionMethods)
